# Documentation Guidelines

* Keep documentation concise and actionable.
* Document only project-specific instructions.
* Include only essential, non-obvious implementation details.
* Exclude generic or redundant sections like “Features” or “Benefits.”
* Focus on how to run and use features; omit obvious information.
